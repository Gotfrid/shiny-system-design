# Plumber REST API as a DataStorage provider for shiny.telemetry

The R code is a courtesy of Appsilon, cloned from [shiny.telemetry](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.telemetry/tree/85add128cfd40d43d4a40694ac891d99625b9876/plumber_rest_api)
repository at `85add128cfd40d43d4a40694ac891d99625b9876` commit.

In this instance, renv-related files have been updated to take advantage of binary linux packages.
Also, a Dockerfile is also not a part of the original code bundle.
